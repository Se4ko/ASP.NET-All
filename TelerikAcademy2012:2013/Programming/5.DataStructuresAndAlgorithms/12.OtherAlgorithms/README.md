## Other Algorithms

1. You are given a set of infinite number of coins (1, 2 and 5) and end value - `N`. Write an algorithm that gives the number of coins needed so that the sum of the coins equals `N`. 
    * Example: `N = 33 => 6 coins x 5 + 1 coin x 2 + 1 coin x 1`
* You are given 3 points `A`, `B` and `C`, forming triangle, and a point `P`. Check if the point `P` is in the triangle or not
