## Using Third-Party APIs

1. Create an "Online Map Tourism" application using Google maps
    * Choose 10 capital cities from the world
    * Make two buttons for "Next" and "Previous" which should iterate through the cities
    * When one of the buttons is clicked, map should pan to the new location of the new city
    * Each city should have Infobox with more information about it on the map
    * Show lists of the cities on the page. If the user chooses a city, the map should pan directly to it
* Combine Google+ and YouTube APIs
    * If the user logins with Google+ the player should show, otherwise it should be hidden
    * When the user logs, his profile picture should be shown
    * Create custom controls for the video - pause, stop, load by id, load playlist, next, previous, mute, unmute, set volume, playback quality options
    * Add options to share the current video on Google+
* Create an application using Facebook API to show all of your Facebook friends' photos and their names. When clicking on the photo the clicked photo must be enlarged. When clicking enlarged photo, then it must resize again to its original size.
* Create an application using Facebook API to show your birthday and location and show it to the screen.
