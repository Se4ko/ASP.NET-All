## Unit Testing

1. Finish the Unit Tests for `MovingGameObject`
* Finish the tests for `Snake `
* Fix the big with the collision detection
* Implement game logic, so the `Snake` dies, when it bites itself
    * And write unit tests
* Test the `Food` constructor
* Refactor the code, so that the `SnakeGame.checkCollisions` method becomes more testable
* \* Extend the game by adding functionality for:
    * `MovingFood`, `MovingObstacle` and `SnakeObstacle`
    * Create Unit Test
    * Use TDD, writing first the tests, then implementing the programming logic
* \* Extend the game by increasing the speed of the snake, when it eats five food objects
    * Create Unit Test
    * Use TDD, writing first the tests, then implementing the programming logic
